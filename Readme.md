## By Adrian Wanjau
The Author of this project is a student at Moringa School currently taking part in the Prep Program in the 4th week.

## DESCRIPTION
This is a webpage in which contains all the work I have done during my forth week of learning at [MORINGA School](https://moringaschool.com/). It used Javascript Query, Bootstrap, and HTML coded from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This webpage is for a shop called Custy's Pizza. The webpage allows the user to order as many pizzas as they want and :
1. Choose the size of pizza they want.
2. Choose what kind of crust they would like.
3. Choose the topping(s) they want on the pizza.
The user can then decide to have it delivered to the location they have stated or not. Once done they can then checkout showing the total cost of the order.
Here is the [Live Site](https://Adrian-Wanjau.github.io/Wk4-IP/)
